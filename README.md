# uiua-html

A [Uiua](https://uiua.org) library for creating and manipulating HTML elements.

Currently *usable*, but not done.

### Short term goals

- [ ] Lists (ordered and unordered)
- [ ] `<pre>` blocks

### Long-term goals

- A frendlier syntax than HTML itself
- High level abstractions for common operations
