# uiua-html

A [Uiua](https://uiua.org) library for creating and manipulating HTML elements.

Currently *usable*, but not done.

> [!WARNING]
> `uiua-html` is experimental until `case` gets stabilized. Please excuse any inconveniencies.

### Short term goals

- [x] Render element properties
- [ ] List abstractions (ordered and unordered)
- [ ] Code blocks

### Long-term goals

- A frendlier syntax than HTML itself
- High level abstractions for common operations
